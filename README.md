# gradual-who-cdc
**Description**: Growth charts that gradually transition from WHO to CDC values from 2 to 5 years. Files available for download: printable charts and tables as well as data tables, code and further instructions for implementation.

**Background**: When evaluating growth in children, the CDC recommends switching between the WHO 2006 Growth Standards and the 2000 CDC Growth Reference at 2 years of age. There is a significant discontinuity between these growth charts at this age. We created growth charts that make the transition from WHO to CDC gradually and smoothly from 2 to 5 years.

This repository contains:

**Printable percentile charts**<br />
-These are available in a single PDF named percentile-charts-print-gradual.<br />
-They are available for 3 overlapping age groups: 0-36 months, 1-6 years, and 2-20 years.<br />
-As noted in the publication, you will see a small jump in the length/height and BMI charts at 2 years. Before 2 years, the charts are based on length, and after 2 years they are based on height. Two-year-olds are 0.7-0.8 cm longer than they are tall. <br />

**Printable data tables**<br />
-This is a PDF named table-print-gradual<br />
-Selected percentiles are available by month for 2-5 years, the ages for which the gradual charts differ from both the WHO and CDC charts.<br />

**Data tables, code, and instructions for analysis and EHR integration**<br />
-The data tables are compressed .csv files. The file names are datatable-gradual-months and datatable-gradual-days. <br />
-See separate documents titled further-info-gradual-[date] and equation-gradual.pdf for further information about the tables, code, and implementation.<br />
-A short R function and Stata do-file are provided that will create gradual z-scores from WHO and CDC z-scores.<br />

The files are available for download and may be used in clinical care and research, including integration into EHRs.
